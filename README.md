# To-Do List

A Windows Forms App that serves as a daily to-do list!

You can save new taks, edit old ones and delete the ones you've finished. Give your tasks a title, a description, tags and even a priority number (from 1 to 5)!

To be implemented:
1. Save all your tasks so you don't have to reinput it every time you open the application
2. Have a progress track
